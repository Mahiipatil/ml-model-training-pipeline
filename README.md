# ML Model Training Pipeline

This project demonstrates a configurable machine learning pipeline built using Python and Scikit-learn. The solution dynamically loads training parameters from a .json.rtf configuration file and supports various models such as RandomForest, LogisticRegression, SVC, and more. It is designed to process the Iris dataset but can be easily adapted for other datasets.
